        <p>
            First of all, of course, Happy Valentine's! I know we've only been talking for like a week, but still, thank you for allowing yourself to be my Valentine. We might not be dating today, but I promise that when you get home, we’ll go out and have a lot of fun together.<br><br>
            I couldn’t give you an actual flower yet since you’re in Germany, so I built this site to give you a virtual message and of course a bouquet of me. I asked you, and you said I’m your favorite—so that’s why it’s a bouquet ko yung nilagay ko, HAHAHAHA.<br><br>
            Also, I’m the one who drew the backgrounds. I wanted it to be pink with roses because you said you liked that, so there you go! I hope all of this will make you happy.<br><br>
            You might be thousands of miles away from me, but I’ll still send all my love to you there. This might even serve as a little confession since we haven’t really had one yet. So, here it is: I just wanna say I like you, Yen. I love everything about you—the way you walk (damn, your aura!), the way you talk (ughh, grabree HAHAHAHA), and the way you act—it makes me feel like I want to treat you as my baby.<br><br>
            And of course, I find you hot, gorgeous, and above all, cute! I love all those unique little things about you, like using “m” for “me” or “I'm” and saying “really?” when you’re excited or blushing. It attracts me so much, and I even find myself adopting those words too. Every time I do, it reminds me of you.<br><br>
            Ayan lang. Always take care and Happy Valentine’s again, Yen. Let’s not rush things—we still have a lifetime to spend with each other. I'm sorry ulit about last time.<br><br>
            –James
